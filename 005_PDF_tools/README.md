# Demo of the app 005_PDF_tools V01

How to use this app (see video below):
1. Open the app hosted in the <a href="https://edrey05-st-app-005.streamlit.app/">Streamlit Community Cloud</a>, running the script with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or through Github Codespaces (an icon for that is the README of the repo Streamlit_projects). Wait for the app to load.
2. Upload any number of pdf files through the sidebar widget.
3. Click the begin button.
4. Edit the table that appears, you can change the position of each pdf (change order), or specify which pages to include by setting the page numbers to start and end (last two columns).
5. Once the order and pages are correct, click the Merge now button.
6. A download button will appear, and you can generate more crops/merges or start over.
